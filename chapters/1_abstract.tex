\section{Abstract}

This project has started with the following question: How can social interaction
be fused with mobile gaming in order to provide a bonding outdoor experience to
a group of people?\newline

The purpose of this project is to create a niche game which provides augmented
reality, rather than augmented virtuality - a game that would bond a group of
people in social interaction by adding competition between two teams and
cooperation within the teams.\newline

This thesis describes the research and development of ''People With Guns'', a
Real Time Tactics game with Shooter elements. ''People With Guns'' is a team
versus team last man standing virtual battle in which the players of the two
teams move in real life, use their mobile phones to communicate and interact
with each other with virtual 'weapons' and 'power-ups'.\newline

We will first describe the steps taken until the idea was properly outlined -
the whole process of searching for inspiration and the construction of the idea.
Then, we will proceed to present the process of developing the application,
intertwined with a dynamic progression of the game concept and
mechanics.\newline
